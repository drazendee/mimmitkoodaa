## Lets get you an editor

Technicall you could just use Notepad to write your code but by using the right editor, you can be more productive and honestly, make it easier for you to write code.

**Why choose an editor?**

- **Be more productive**
  - Syntax highlighting helps you understand your code
  - Intellisense helps you with code completion and providing information about available parameters and members
  - Read about the [JavaScript support on VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript) to understand syntax highlightin, intellisense and others.
- **Extensiblity and integrations to other services**
  - A good editor is able to extend the out-of-the-box editor with tools, debuggers, commands, themes and language support and other functionality that's built by the community.
  - Integrations to easily build and deploy solutions to cloud services, like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Cloud Services.
  - Integration with source control, so you can manage different versions of your code, collaborate and more.
- **Has an active community**
  - Heathly community that is working together to maintain and update the product
  - Has active and up to date guides, tutorials and forums to ask for help
  - Allow anyone to report issues, fix issues or request new features (that usually get voted on)

:exclamation: In this workshop we'll be using Visual Studio Code. A free and open-source editor that works on Windows, macOS and Linux. [Download it here](http://code.visualstudio.com)
